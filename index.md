This innovative project uses Big Data to predict real estate appreciation or depreciation in the Northeast region of Brazil. 
The goal is to help brokers, real estate consultants, and urban managers anticipate market trends, enabling more informed and strategic decisions. With an interactive web interface and comprehensive data from several Northeastern capitals, our application offers valuable insights into the behavior of the regional real estate market.
