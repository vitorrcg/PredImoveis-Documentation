<h2>Main Libraries:</h2>

<strong>Streamlit:</strong> web framework for creating the dashboard interface quickly and Pythonically

<strong>Plotly:</strong> interactive data visualization in graphs, built into Streamlit

<strong>Pandas:</strong> tabular data manipulation and analysis

<strong>PyTest and Selenium:</strong> tools used for automated testing of the application and interface

<strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> Environment used for initial exploration and data cleansing.

<strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Terraform for describing the infrastructure in code, provisioning AWS services (especially EC2 for hosting the app).

<strong>Cloud Platform:</strong> AWS EC2 ‚Äì a virtual machine in the cloud where the Streamlit dashboard can run continuously for end-user access.

<strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions ‚Äì a pipeline configured to integrate and eventually deploy the project automatically (build, test, and deploy). This ensures quality and agility in deliveries.

<strong>Version Control:</strong> Git & GitHub ‚Äì team collaboration and versioning of all source code, notebooks and infrastructure, allowing traceability of contributions and parallel work via branches.
