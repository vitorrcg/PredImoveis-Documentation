<h2>Tools</h2>

This page details the main tools, libraries, and infrastructure used in the project.

<strong>Main Libraries</strong>
- **Streamlit:** Web framework for building interactive dashboards quickly and Pythonically.
- **Plotly:** Interactive data visualization library, integrated with Streamlit for dynamic charts.
- **Pandas:** Powerful library for tabular data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Environment for initial data exploration, experimentation, and cleansing.

<strong>Testing tools</strong>
- **PyTest:** Framework for automated unit and integration testing of the application.
- **Selenium:** Tool for automated testing of the web interface, simulating user interactions.

<strong>Infrastructure</strong>
- **Terraform:** Infrastructure-as-code tool used to describe and provision cloud resources, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.

<strong>Cloud Platform</strong>
- **AWS EC2:** Cloud-based virtual machine hosting the Streamlit dashboard, providing continuous access to end-users.

<strong>CI/CD</strong>
- **GitHub Actions:** Continuous integration and deployment pipeline configured to automatically build, test, and deploy the project, ensuring code quality and delivery speed.

<strong>Version Control</strong>
- **Git & GitHub:** Source code versioning, team collaboration, and traceability of contributions through branches and pull requests.

<h2>Main Libraries:</h2>

<strong>Streamlit:</strong> web framework for creating the dashboard interface quickly and Pythonically

<strong>Plotly:</strong> interactive data visualization in graphs, built into Streamlit

<strong>Pandas:</strong> tabular data manipulation and analysis

<strong>PyTest and Selenium:</strong> tools used for automated testing of the application and interface

<strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> Environment used for initial exploration and data cleansing.

<strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Terraform for describing the infrastructure in code, provisioning AWS services (especially EC2 for hosting the app).

<strong>Cloud Platform:</strong> AWS EC2 – a virtual machine in the cloud where the Streamlit dashboard can run continuously for end-user access.

<strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions – a pipeline configured to integrate and eventually deploy the project automatically (build, test, and deploy). This ensures quality and agility in deliveries.

<strong>Version Control:</strong> Git & GitHub – team collaboration and versioning of all source code, notebooks and infrastructure, allowing traceability of contributions and parallel work via branches. -->
